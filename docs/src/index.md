# AeroAcoustics

AeroAcoustics.jl is a package for post-processing of microphone array measurements.
It aims to provide basic functionality for computing cross-spectral matrices and frequency-domain beamforming.

The package repository is here: <https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/ollyl/AeroAcoustics.jl>

Currently this package is under heavy development, and many features are being added in the coming period.
In future releases, deconvolution of beamforming maps and other techniques for sound field reconstruction will be added.

An introduction to the API and a simple example case can be found in this [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/ollyl/AeroAcoustics.jl/raw/master/examples/Introduction.ipynb).
