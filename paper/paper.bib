@article{acoular,
   abstract = {Acoular is an open source object-oriented Python package for microphone array data processing. It supports various methods for sound source characterization and mapping. The background of these methods, which rely on synchronously captured microphone signals, is shortly introduced, and the requirements for a software that implements these methods are discussed. The object-oriented design based on Python allows for easy-to-use scripting and graphical user interfaces, the practical combination with other data handling and scientific computing libraries, and the possibility to extend the software by implementing new processing methods with minimal effort. Built-in result caching and fast C++ based parallelized implementation of core routines is explained. Together with data handling procedures that can accommodate the huge amounts of measured data needed, this makes the application of Acoular to industrial-scale problems possible. Basic examples of Acoular use and extension are given.},

@book{Allen2002c,
   abstract = {The goal of aeroacoustic measurements is to provide a basis for assessing mechanisms of noise generation, and to develop methods of reducing noise to more acceptable levels. However, the measurements themselves are complex, and require a deep understanding of the experimental facility utilized (such as a wind tunnel), measurement instrumentation, and data analysis techniques. In this volume recent advances in the measurement and understanding of aerodynamically generated sound are presented by leaders in the development of new techniques in this field. Both basic and applied problems are covered in detail. 1. Microphone Measurements In and Out of Airstream. Research Objectives (and What to Measure). Wind Tunnel Background Noise Including Flow-Induced Noise. Microphone Placement. Reflections in a Semi-Anechoic Environment. Source Identification by Signal Processing. Convection Effects and Doppler Shift. Sound Propagation Through Shear Layers in Open-Jet Wind Tunnels. Change in Sound Pressure Level Caused by Refraction. Microphone Corrections at High Frequency.
